Abstract: 
As machine learning becomes more interlinked with data-driven decision-making processes within critical industries like supply chain management, the transparency and explainability of such models will grow in importance. Decision making guided by black-box optimisation methods has proved to be powerful overall, but high risks are associated with such practices. If stakeholders in charge of decision making are not able to interpret complex machine learning model results, this can negatively impact the confidence that such stakeholders have in acting on the insights given by such models. Decision Trees (DTs) have been known to be highly interpretable in the field. Adding more complexity to DT models can result in boosts in performance, but with the downside of sacrificing interpretability. As a solution, this paper presents the use of Genetic Decision Trees (GDTs, DTs optimised with a genetic algorithm (GA)) as an interpretable machine learning method for solving the Inventory Management (IM) Problem. Different parameters of the GA were investigated, along with different population initialisation techniques and maximum tree depths. The approach was also benchmarked against the most popular IM heuristics. GDTs were shown to outperform all common heuristics whilst maintaining interpretability, and they were also able to pinpoint features of the problem with real-world relevance. Additional, use-case-specific insights were also uncovered, highlighting the promising nature of the proposed approach.
